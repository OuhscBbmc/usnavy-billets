# usnavy-billets
This project explores possibilities of optimally assigning naval officers to billets.  The demonstration is viewable in [this report](https://github.com/OuhscBbmc/usnavy-billets/blob/master/analysis/select-1/select-1.md).

**Notes**:

1. The project is under the initial direction of [Richard C. Childers](mailto:richard.childers@navy.mil), CDR NPC, PERS-4415, with advisement from [Alvin Roth](http://web.stanford.edu/~alroth/).
1. This demonstration was developed primarily by [Will Beasley](http://ouhsc.edu/bbmc/team/), Assistant Professor of Research, University of Oklahoma College of Medicine, [Department of Pediatrics](http://www.oumedicine.com/pediatrics).  The code developed for the billet marketplace project is open source and [available online](https://github.com/OuhscBbmc/usnavy-billets).  
1. The project members are appreciative of the open source [`matchingMarkets`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=matchingMarkets) R package, (independently developed by [Thilo Klein](https://github.com/thiloklein) since [2013](https://github.com/thiloklein/matchingMarkets/commits/master)) that implements the Gale-Shapley (1962) Deferred Acceptance Algorithm. For further discussion, see [Roth (2007) Deferred Acceptance Algorithms: History, Theory, Practice, and
Open Questions](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/2579651/Roth_Deferred%20Acceptance.pdf) and the [2012 Nobel Prize material](http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2012/press.html).
